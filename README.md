# Rogue-DunGen
A simple roguelike map generator
  
TODO:
----
1. Rewrite the code base to have three main classes:  <sub>
  Tile, Region, and Level  
The Tile class will mostly be a placeholder at this point.  
The Region class will be made up of a set of coordinates that correspond to tiles (maybe even directly point to them).  
The Level class will be made up of Regions and Tiles and will have most of the evaluation functions built in. (But NOT the maze/room generation functions).</sub>  
2. Finish maze and unification code and start work on the stariwell code.
3. Finish up the generator by adding a decoration system that will place stuff around the level.
4. First release*
